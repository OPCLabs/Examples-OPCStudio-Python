This directory contains examples in Python. The examples cover OPC Data Access (OPC DA) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), including OPC UA PubSub. 

The examples work with our sample servers (of which some reside on the Web, and some are installed using the OPC Studio Setup program).

The QuickOPC package is needed. Install it using "pip install opclabs_quickopc".
