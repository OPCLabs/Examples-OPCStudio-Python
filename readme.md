This directory contains examples for OPC client and subscriber development in Python. The examples cover OPC Data Access 
(OPC DA), OPC Alarms&Events (OPC A&E), OPC XML, and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) specifications, including OPC UA 
PubSub. They are supported on Microsoft Windows and Linux.

The examples work with our sample servers and publishers. Most of them reside on the Web; OPC "Classic" servers for Windows
are installed using the [OPC Studio Setup program](https://www.opclabs.com/download).

The QuickOPC package is needed. Install it using "pip install opclabs_quickopc".
